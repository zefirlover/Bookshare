To start the application you need:
- node.js
- angular CLI
- PostgreSQL

At first, add `node_modules` to the 'client' folder
Then create db in the Postgres (you can use pgAdmin4 app) and add a new migration. Then start an API.
After that you can start the frontend part by using `ng serve --live-reload=true` command on the 'client' folder
